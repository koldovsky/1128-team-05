              and mix traditional recipes with new approaches.

              While cooking our burgers, we use only certified Piedmontese beef
              which means that it is nourishing and soft by nature, has minimum
              calories and fat but has a high protein level. This meat is the
              result of a special feature of the Piedmontese breed, which lies
              in the development of lean, heavy musculature in the production of
              beef, which does not depend on fat marbling (as a rule in other
              breeds of cattle) to reach softness. Certified Piedmontese cattle
              are grown without using any steroids, growth hormones, or
              antibiotics, which ensures the highest quality and nutrient beef.
