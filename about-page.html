              While cooking our burgers, we use only certified Piedmontese beef
              which means that it is nourishing and soft by nature, has minimum
              calories and fat but has a high protein level. This meat is the
              result of a special feature of the Piedmontese breed, which lies
              in the development of lean, heavy musculature in the production of
              beef, which does not depend on fat marbling (as a rule in other
              breeds of cattle) to reach softness. Certified Piedmontese cattle
              are grown without using any steroids, growth hormones, or
              antibiotics, which ensures the highest quality and nutrient beef.
