          >In early 2010, Andrew Peterson and Mary Stone found their way through
          numerous food trucks and burger joints in San Francisco, Texas,
          Austin, and Miami as they could. They have worked in the Mercat Cross
          Hotel for several years and decided to launch their cafe food offering
          with something new and unusual.</span

        <span class="our-tack__description-item"
          >Impressed by what they revealed in the food truck industry, they
          returned to Los Angeles and instantly began to search for a food truck
          to put it the cafe hall. But there appeared to be one problem: the
          doorway was too small to get the truck inside.</span

        <span class="our-tack__description-item"
          >In spite of this, they took out a lease on an old mechanicâ€™s
          warehouse around the corner and put the truck there. After playing
          with various cuisines, Andrew and Mary found out that a burger truck
          was the best way to start with. The next several months they offered
          numerous burger tastings, searched for local producers, experienced
          cheesemakers and bakers, and incalculable tests with friends and even
          family members until they eventually created that special, ideal
          burger. So that year, 2010, Freddy Burgers was born.</span
